        <p class="text-justify">In May 2014, the European Court of Justice made a <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/may/14/explainer-right-to-be-forgotten-the-newest-cultural-shibboleth">historic decision</a> that made many think differently about the internet and who we are online. Mario Costeja González, a Spaniard, had long-since paid back his debts from the 90s, but two short newspaper notices about the auction for his foreclosed home still showed up prominently when someone searched for his name online. He challenged Google to remove the respective articles from its search results &mdash; and <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2014-05/cp140070en.pdf">won</a>. Subsequently, Google, and all other search engines, had to provide a mechanism by which people could request removal of a specific search result if the content it linked to is &#8220;inadequate, irrelevant or excessive&#8221;. Critics argued that shady politicians and criminals will likely abuse the ruling to white-wash their online portfolio, but actual data on the nature of requests was missing. In spite of <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/14/dear-google-open-letter-from-80-academics-on-right-to-be-forgotten">calls from numerous academics for more transparency</a>, Google did not share statistics on the requests it received.</p>
        <p class="text-justify">The numbers graphed below come from Google's own <a href="https://www.google.com/transparencyreport/removals/europeprivacy/">Transparency Report</a>. The source code of the website actually contained more data than the report visualised in its front-end. About three months ago, the data disappeared but <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150326090702*/https://www.google.com/transparencyreport/removals/europeprivacy/">snapshots on WayBack Machine</a>, the 'Archive of the Internet', are testimonies to its prior existence.</p>

        <div class="col-lg-6 col-lg-offset-0">
          <p class="text-justify">Obviously, the number of delinking requests sent to Google scales with the number of citizens in a country. Germany and France, the most populous European countries, also contribute the largest number of requests. But this is less interesting than the question: Given an equally sized city in all those countries, how many people send a request to Google? One would expect its similar accross countries. That is not what we see.</p>

        <div class="col-lg-6 col-lg-offset-0">
          <p class="text-justify">Normalising for the population size in the country that is linked to a request, shows a high application rate in rather small countries, above all Estonia. Importantly, the relation of the person making the request and the country, is not neccessarily citizenship. According to a <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B8syaai6SSfiT0EwRUFyOENqR3M/preview">letter from Google to the Article 29 Working Party</a> "the data subject will need some connection to that country, which will normally, but not always, mean that he or she is a resident in it." - Some food for thought, maybe...</p>

          <h1>Different countries, different issues...</h1>

        </div>

        <div class="col-lg-6 col-lg-offset-0">
          <p class="text-justify">The source code underlying Google's Transparency Report contained a breakdown of requests into five issue categories: 'private_personal_info','serious_crime', 'political', 'public_figure' and 'cp'. There was no explantion, just these labels. The key is that Google labeled 95% of requests made under the right to be forgotten as 'private personal info', which suggests that these are issues you and your neighbour, not a criminal, not a public figure, could have. Notably this is in sharp contrast to the examples of request Google shows on its <a href="http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/removals/europeprivacy/?hl=en">Transparency Report</a> website.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-6 col-lg-offset-0">
          <p class="text-justify">Although requests concerning private information dominate the statistics throughout Europe, there are some curious differences between countries. Italy's share of 'serious crime' requests, for example, is higher than other countries. This country variation could have many reasons: Who is making the request (e.g. Are people informed about the Right to be Forgotten)? How is crime and political reporting dealt with in the first place (e.g. some nordic countries don't name criminals in the news)? What is the legal framework for certain topics in that country?</p>

        <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2">
          <p class="text-center"><br>These are interesting questions, which I hope local journalist can <a href="https://github.com/sytpp/rtbf">help to uncover</a>.<br><br></p>

          <h1>Granted, Rejected, Rejected, Rejected...</h1>
          <br>
          <p class="text-justify">So, what about the concerns raised by the critiques of the Right to be Forgotten - is it giving criminals and shady politicans a shortcut to clean up their online curriculum? Probably not. While around half of request labeled by Google as 'private_personal_info' are granted, the great majority of request in the other four catgegories are rejected. So, while 1,892 request may have been granted in connection with crime and politics, the Right to be Forgotten served nearly 100,000 requests for 'private_personal_info', presumably just normal people concerned with digital privacy. Paul Bernal, technology law lecturer at UEA Law School, argues this shows that the Right to be Forgotten seems to be a legitimate piece of law. “If most of the requests are private and personal ones, then it’s a good law for the individuals concerned,” he says. “It seems there is a need for this - and <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/nov/13/terrorists-right-to-be-forgotten-online-sajid-javid-tory-bill-of-rights">people go for it for genuine reasons</a>”.</p>

          <p class="text-justify">Given a universal set of criteria to give a thumbs-up or thumbs-down, a request should be decided equally in each country. Ok, we know that different countries have slightly different request issues, so its only fair to compare within one group. Here we are looking at Google's decisions for the issue type 'private_personal_info', the largest category by far, covering 96% of requests. Google's compliance varies a lot between those countries.
